# Changelog

## 1.12.0 — WASDE stocks-to-use, storylines, figure drill-down, source-value ledger

### Added
- **USDA WASDE balance sheet is live.** The soybean cell-extraction is finished (the report is
  SSRS-matrix XML — soybeans are the acreage / $-per-bushel matrix in the combined "Soybeans and
  Products" table, distinguished from meal and oil positionally). Adds a **U.S. soybean
  stocks-to-use** scorer to the Markets signal board — level-based, so it reads from a single
  release (below ~8% tight/supportive, above ~15% ample/bearish) — plus two charts (U.S. ending
  stocks in mln bu, stocks-to-use %). World ending stocks (MMT) ride in the WASDE item summary.
- **Storylines** — the monitor now auto-clusters recent items into the handful of ongoing named
  threads the news is really about (45Z, renewable diesel, China trade, EUDR…), each with a "what
  changed & why it matters" summary and a dated timeline that links out to sources. A 🧵 panel on
  the homepage, a Refresh button, and a `storylines` CLI command; threads persist and accumulate
  across runs.
- **Figure drill-down** — when an answer, brief, or education card names a market series ("U.S.
  soybean crush", "stocks-to-use"…), that name now links straight to its chart on the Markets tab.

### Changed
- **The Sources page is now a value ledger, framed by class.** Official (AI-triaged) sources show
  their relevance pass-rate; News and Markets sources — which aren't triaged — show "coverage feed"
  instead of a misleading 0% that made them look like noise. Fetched counts show last-7-days and
  all-time.

### Fixed
- **Token-budget reliability on Sonnet 5.** Sonnet 5 runs adaptive thinking by default, and thinking
  counts against a call's token budget — on tight budgets it could consume the whole allowance and
  return truncated or empty output. Thinking is now disabled where it adds nothing (storylines, item
  summaries), and the Ask box, Market Pulse, Market-education brief, and farmer cards were given
  token headroom.

## 1.11.0 — Crop-weather engine; WASDE & Barchart groundwork

### Added
- **Crop-weather engine** — an anomaly-vs-normal weather layer that reasons weather → supply →
  price. The Open-Meteo adapter now computes recent 30-day precipitation and heat as **percentiles
  against ~20 years of ERA5 history** for the U.S. soybean belt and the South American crop
  (production-weighted; free, no key — no PRISM needed). A new `weather.js` engine turns those into
  **phenology-weighted signal-board scorers** — stress in a yield-sensitive window (e.g. U.S.
  pod-fill) supports price; a benign crop weighs on it, and off-season regions drop off the board —
  plus a weather read injected into the Analyst Note, Market Pulse, and Ask box. Two new Markets
  charts (U.S. and S. America weather anomaly).

### Groundwork (ships disabled; ready to switch on)
- **USDA WASDE balance sheet** adapter — the machine-readable feed (`esmis.nal.usda.gov`), the
  release backfill, and the adapter are in place; the soybean cell-extraction (soybeans vs. meal/oil
  in the combined U.S. table) needs finishing, so it ships **disabled**. Adds U.S. stocks-to-use +
  world stocks + a stocks-to-use signal once enabled.
- **Barchart** adapter — futures / forward-curve / local-basis scaffold. No-ops without
  `BARCHART_API_KEY`; a config-flip and one live test once the key lands.

### Changed
- The market-series refresh now skips **disabled** sources — no wasted fetches.

## 1.10.0 — One daily brief, market education on the Markets tab, smarter report models

### Changed
- **The twice-daily AM/PM policy briefs are now a single "Run policy brief now"** on the homepage,
  and a quiet scan no longer saves a blank "no news" brief. The twice-daily run still refreshes
  Markets, News, alerts, and education cards on schedule — it just stays silent on days with no
  policy movement instead of cluttering Saved briefs. Each report button now carries a one-line
  description of what it does.
- **Farmer market-education cards moved from the homepage to the Markets tab** (renamed "For
  farmers: what to watch"), sitting alongside the market data they interpret. The homepage now leads
  with the Ask box and the reports.

### Models
- **The Analyst Note now runs on Claude Opus 4.8 with adaptive thinking** — the deep, forward-looking
  report gets the strongest reasoning model for its "around the corner" analysis. Override with
  `ANALYST_MODEL` in `.env`.
- **The base model moves to Claude Sonnet 5** (`BRIEF_MODEL`) — a better model at the same price for
  the daily brief, the weekly/monthly/farmer/education memos, Market Pulse, the education cards, and
  the Ask box.

## 1.9.0 — Signals, four reports, the trigger card engine, macro data & more

### Added
- **Marketing trigger card engine** — evaluates seasonal, positioning, and report-timing triggers
  and writes farmer **market-education cards** ("what's happening / what history shows / review your
  plan") on the homepage. Strictly education, never advice — a hard banned-phrasing filter, the
  standard footer, and the RP-HPO framing are built in.
- **FRED macro** — U.S. broad dollar index + 10-year Treasury yield, with a dollar signal (a strong
  dollar caps export competitiveness). **Brazil production trend** (IBGE PAM, the multi-decade rise).
- **Deeper News digest** — now reads email bodies and fetches the linked article's text, distilling
  from real content, not just headlines.
- **Set-aside archive** for the Laws/Rules/Decisions feed (recoverable), an **optional note** on 👎
  that teaches the AI triage, and the **Settings panel moved onto the Logs page**.
- The report calendar now uses the authoritative 2026 USDA dates with impact levels.

### Also in this release (from the 1.8.0 work)
- **Market signals board**, **Analyst Note** + **Market Pulse** reports, **interactive chart date
  ranges** (6-month default), **release-calendar awareness**, a **"what changed" alert feed**, a
  **freshness monitor**, and corn price + the soybean:corn ratio + CFTC positioning series.

## 1.7.0 — Trend-aware answers · market-education brief · more market data

### Added
- **Deeper trend retrieval** — the Ask box and memos now see each market series over its *full*
  history: year-over-year, the historical range with the latest value's percentile, and a seasonal
  read (vs. the same month across years). So it can answer "is this seasonally normal / how does it
  compare to years past," not just report the latest number.
- **Market-education brief** (🎓 on the homepage / `memo education`) — a plain-language, strictly
  nonpartisan "teach, don't tell" daily brief for farmers: what moved and *why*, a rotating teaching
  concept, and what to watch — grounded only in the data, with every figure cited by source + date.
  Backed by a new **curriculum + glossary** knowledge base (`seed-curriculum`).
- **New market data (Markets tab):**
  - **U.S. Drought Monitor** — Iowa area in drought (D1+) and abnormally dry+ (D0+), weekly.
  - **Corn price** (Iowa vs. U.S.) and the **soybean:corn price ratio** — the relative-value / acreage read.
  - **Brazil soybean production + area** (IBGE) — the competitor-supply signal (queryable).
- **More ag-news feeds** on the News tab: farmdoc daily, Farm Policy News, No-Till Farmer, Feedstuffs.

### Changed
- Ten interactive charts on the Markets tab now, each with hover value + date and a CSV download.

## 1.6.0 — Master query engine · on-demand memos · interactive charts · more market data

### Added
- **Ask across everything** — the homepage "Ask the Bean Brief" box now retrieves across all
  streams in one call: Laws/Rules/Decisions + News items, the **market timeseries** (price,
  crush, stocks, feedstock share, basis, fund positioning, exports, barge freight, weather),
  tracked items, comment deadlines, and recent briefs — so answers can connect a policy or
  trade development to the market numbers, with citations.
- **On-demand memos (memo mode)** — the same engine, scoped to a window and told to write a
  report: **Weekly memo**, **Monthly review**, and a plain-language, strictly nonpartisan
  **Farmer update**. Buttons on the homepage; `memo <weekly|monthly|farmer>` on the CLI.
- **Interactive Markets charts** — charts are now rendered with uPlot: **hover to read the
  exact value + date**, with real axes and gridlines. Seven charts, each with a CSV download.
- **New market data (Markets tab):**
  - **Soybean export inspections** + **net export sales** (USDA Ag Transport / Socrata) — a
    live stand-in for the FAS Export Sales report while its API is offline.
  - **Mississippi barge freight** ($/ton) — a driver of the Gulf export basis.
  - **U.S. soybean crop condition** (% good/excellent, Iowa vs. U.S.) — the in-season signal.
  - **U.S. Corn Belt weather** — a domestic crop-stress read alongside South America.

### Changed
- The **twice-daily farmer twin is retired** — the farmer update is now the on-demand `farmer`
  memo preset (generated when asked, over a chosen window), so scheduled runs never pay for it.
- The weekly memo now spans markets + news + items, not just the week's briefs.

## 1.5.0 — Markets dashboard (charts + CSV) · homepage search · more sources

### Added
- **Markets charts** — a timeseries layer feeds inline charts on the Markets tab, each with a **CSV download**:
  - **Biofuel feedstock market share** — every lipid feedstock in U.S. biodiesel + renewable diesel (soybean
    oil vs. corn oil, canola, used cooking oil, tallow, animal fats…), so you can watch soy's share vs. the competition.
  - **Soybean price received** (Iowa vs. U.S.), **U.S. crush**, **U.S. ending stocks**.
  - `market-refresh` CLI; series refresh automatically on each run.
- **USDA AMS basis** on the Markets tab (Iowa cash soybean price + basis).
- **More sources** in the registry — ag-news RSS (CFTC, USDA, EPA, Farm Progress, Agri-Pulse, ASA, RFA,
  Growth Energy, Clean Fuels, Iowa Soybean) and LCFS/Iowa agencies (CARB, Oregon DEQ, WA Ecology,
  NM Environment, Iowa DNR).

### Changed
- **Search moved to the homepage** ("Ask the Bean Brief") — the separate Search page is gone; ask questions
  right from Home. Answers still draw on stored items + briefs.

## 1.4.1 — LRD rename · in-place triage · AMS basis · RSS feeds

### Added
- **AMS basis adapter** (`usda_ams`) — Iowa state-average soybean cash price + **basis** on the Markets tab
  (your "basis vs. the board at a glance"). Free key `USDA_AMS_API_KEY`.
- **Ag-news RSS feeds** wired into the News pipeline: CFTC, USDA, EPA, Farm Progress, Agri-Pulse, ASA, RFA,
  Growth Energy, Clean Fuels, Iowa Soybean.

### Changed
- **Items → "Laws, Rules & Decisions."**
- **👍/👎 and 📌 track update in place** (AJAX) — the list no longer jumps to the top, so you can scroll
  and triage continuously.
- **AI summaries are permanent** — re-opening a panel returns the stored summary (no new AI call), and the
  🧠 icon shows **✓ stored** once one exists (doubles as a "reviewed" marker). Survives version updates.
- **All timestamps render in Central time.**

## 1.4.0 — Markets tab + demand pipeline · News/Items split

Big feature release. The portal is now organized into four tabs by *information class*,
and a new demand-side data pipeline feeds a Markets tab.

### Added
- **Four-tab portal.** A per-source class (official / news / markets) routes each item:
  - **Items** — regulatory/legal only (Federal Register, bills, dockets, court, admin rules): the clean flow.
  - **News** — collector newsletters + legislator press (kept out of the policy brief).
  - **Markets** — demand-side data (below).
- **Markets / demand pipeline — 4 new free sources:** `usda_nass` (Iowa price, US production/stocks),
  `eia` (soybean-oil → biodiesel/renewable-diesel feedstock + diesel price), `cftc` (managed-money
  fund positioning), `open_meteo` (S. American soybean-region weather stress).
- **News-source registry** — farmdoc, Punchbowl, POLITICO, RFA, Growth Energy, Brownfield,
  Agri-Pulse, Carney Appleby, Torrey — with a narrow/broad boost split so broad publishers
  surface on relevance rather than automatically.
- `scripts/subscribe.mjs inbox` — see what's landing in the collector, by tag.

### Changed
- **News + Markets items never enter the policy brief** — partitioned by class right after
  collection, so a market item that matches a policy keyword ("soybean oil → biodiesel") no
  longer leaks into the brief.

### Keys (all free; add to `/data/.env`)
- `NASS_API_KEY`, `EIA_API_KEY` light up NASS/EIA now; `USDA_AMS_API_KEY` (basis) and `FAS_API_KEY`
  (export sales) enable those when added. CFTC + Open-Meteo need none.

## 1.3.1 — packaging fix

- **Fix:** include `registry.json` (and `scripts/`) in the Docker image — they were
  missing from the Dockerfile `COPY`, so on the Pi the registry seed file never reached
  `/data` and the registry synced empty. No code changes.

## 1.3.0 — v2 foundation (Entity Registry · entity collection · two-render brief)

Additive extension of the v1 pipeline — the existing collect → score → triage →
brief → deliver flow is unchanged, and every new source/render is gated so the
running app is never broken. See `docs/V2.md` for architecture and go-live steps.

### Added
- **Entity Registry** — `entity`/`channel` tables (`src/store.js`), `src/registry.js`,
  and a hand-seeded `registry.json` (IA federal delegation, statewide execs, state +
  county parties). Deterministic attribution by plus-tag / domain / handle / external id.
- **Geo resolution** — `src/geo.js` resolves an address or venue to county + legislative
  districts via the free U.S. Census Geocoder (memoized in `geo_cache`).
- **Entity-driven collection** — `collect.js` hands registry channels to adapters:
  - `rss` — entity press/news feeds (RSS 2.0 + Atom).
  - `email_intake` — reads a dedicated collector inbox over IMAP and attributes each
    message to an entity. Disabled until a Gmail App Password is set.
- **Registry seeders** — `registry-seed openstates|fec|socrata` and `registry-refresh`.
  OpenStates (state legislators) and FEC (federal candidates) are live; Socrata/IECDB
  is compliance-gated (Iowa Code § 68B.32A(7)).
- **Two-render brief** — an optional farmer-facing, strictly nonpartisan render
  (`output.farmerBrief`), sent to `FARMER_BRIEF_TO` or saved/web like any brief.
- **Registry web page** (`/registry`) with channel-health monitoring; new CLI commands
  `registry-sync` / `registry-seed` / `registry-refresh` / `registry-health`.
- **Collector tooling** — `docs/collector-gmail.md` runbook + `scripts/subscribe.mjs`
  (subscribe worksheet + double-opt-in confirmation-link clicker).

### Changed
- Scoring boosts registry-sourced items; triage records `entityId` / `type` / `geo`.
- `seen_items` gains `entity_id` / `item_type` / `geo` columns (auto-migrated).

### Dependencies
- Added `imapflow` and `mailparser` (email-intake; lazy-loaded so they never affect
  the rest of the app until email-intake runs).

## 1.2.0
Rebrand to "The Bean Brief"; ISA theme + logo; Focus Area watchlist engine; per-item
AI summaries; split Sources/Watchlist pages; email delivery.
