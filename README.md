# 🌱 polibrief

**Twice-daily policy intelligence briefs for Iowa soybean priorities — on autopilot.**

polibrief watches five government data sources, filters everything against a topic
watchlist *you* control, has Claude (Anthropic's AI) triage what actually matters to
Iowa soy, and writes a structured policy brief — delivered to a web page, saved as
markdown, and optionally posted to a Microsoft Teams channel.

| Source | What it covers | Key needed? |
|---|---|---|
| Federal Register | Federal rules, proposed rules, notices (EPA, USDA, Treasury/IRS, CFTC, USTR) | No |
| Congress.gov | Federal bills with recent activity | Free key |
| LegiScan | State bills in IA, IL, MN, NE, IN, MO, WI (add "US" for full-text Congress search) | Free key |
| EUR-Lex | EU regulations (Official Journal, L series) | No |
| Iowa Admin Bulletin | Iowa administrative rule filings | No |
| Regulations.gov | Rulemaking dockets + comment deadlines | Same key as Congress.gov |
| CourtListener | Federal litigation (Roundup/FIFRA, WOTUS, pipeline cases) | No |

Cost discipline is built in: every item is remembered in a local database so nothing
is ever paid for twice, each source only fetches what's new since its last success,
and the free local filter runs *before* any AI sees anything.

## First-Time Setup (on your computer)

1. Install [Node.js 20 or newer](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version).
2. In a terminal, from this folder:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste in your API keys (next section).
4. Test without spending anything:
   ```
   node src/index.js run --dry-run
   ```
5. Produce your first real brief:
   ```
   node src/index.js run --edition am
   ```
6. Read it in your browser:
   ```
   node src/index.js serve
   ```
   …then open http://localhost:8484

## Getting Your API Keys

- **Anthropic** (powers the AI triage + brief): create a key at
  [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) → API Keys. Paid, but cheap
  here — see Cost Notes below.
- **Congress.gov**: free, instant. Sign up at
  [api.congress.gov/sign-up](https://api.congress.gov/sign-up/) (keys are issued
  through api.data.gov — a Data.gov key is the same thing).
- **LegiScan**: free (30,000 queries/month). Register at
  [legiscan.com/legiscan](https://legiscan.com/legiscan) → API tab.
- **Federal Register and EUR-Lex**: no keys needed.
- **Teams (optional)**: in your Teams channel → ⋯ → Workflows/Connectors → create an
  *Incoming Webhook*, and paste its URL into `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env`.

## Reading a Brief

Each brief has: **🔴 Top developments** (the 3–5 things to know), sections per source
(federal rules, federal bills, state bills, EU regulation, Iowa admin rules — empty
sections are omitted), **⏰ Deadlines** (comment periods, soonest first), and a stats
footer showing what was scanned and whether any source was skipped that run.

Every item is one line: what it is, why it matters to Iowa soy, and a link to the
primary source.

## All Commands

```
node src/index.js run --edition am     # full pipeline (am or pm)
node src/index.js run --dry-run        # fetch + score only — NO AI calls, costs $0
node src/index.js run --source legiscan  # test one source
node src/index.js weekly               # the Friday-style synthesis memo, on demand
node src/index.js query "45Z guidance" # ask a question over everything stored
node src/index.js audit                # per-source stats + AI spend this month
node src/index.js serve                # web UI + automatic scheduling
```

## The web app

Everything below happens in the browser (the Umbrel tile / port 8484):

- **Home** — run buttons (AM / PM / weekly memo), saved briefs, upcoming comment
  deadlines, per-source status lights with 7-day counts, and the full watchlist
  editor: add/remove keywords, search phrases, LegiScan states, whole topics,
  topic weights, schedule times, and pipeline thresholds. Run failures show up
  in a red banner right on the page.
- **Items** — browse and search everything polibrief has stored. 📌 **track** an
  item and any new activity gets its own section at the top of future briefs.
  👍/👎 an item and the AI triage is told about your correction on future runs.
- **Search** — ask questions in plain English over your whole archive
  ("what happened with 45Z guidance?"); answers cite items with links.
- **📅 Deadline calendar** — subscribe to `/calendar.ics` from Outlook
  (Calendar → Add calendar → Subscribe from web) and every comment deadline
  appears on your work calendar automatically.
- **RSS** — `/feed.xml` for anything that can subscribe to feeds.
- **Brief pages** — copy the markdown, email it, or re-post it to Teams with one click.
- **Logs** — recent activity, in plain English, when something looks off.
- Scheduler runs the AM/PM briefs, the weekly memo (default Friday 5 PM), and a
  nightly backup (kept 14 days, in the data folder under `backups/`).
- Optional password: set `POLIBRIEF_PASSWORD=...` in `.env` and restart.

## Editing watchlist.json (no code changes, ever)

`watchlist.json` is the single source of truth. Edit it, save, done — the next run
picks it up. (On Umbrel/Docker, edit the copy in the app's data folder.)

**Add a keyword to an existing topic** — find the topic, add to its `keywords` list:
```json
"keywords": ["biodiesel", "renewable diesel", "sustainable aviation fuel", "SAF",
             "soybean oil", "used cooking oil"]
```

**Add a whole new topic** — copy an existing block and adjust. `weight` (1–10) is how
much you care; `queries` are what get sent to each source's search (leave a source's
list empty to skip it for this topic):
```json
{
  "id": "prop-12-style", "label": "Animal Housing Standards", "weight": 6,
  "keywords": ["animal housing", "confinement standards", "Proposition 12"],
  "queries": {
    "federal_register": ["animal confinement"],
    "congress_gov": ["animal housing standards"],
    "legiscan": ["animal confinement"],
    "eurlex_oj": []
  }
}
```

**Track another state** — add its two-letter code to `sources.legiscan.states`.

**Disable a source** — set its `"enabled": false`.

**Change budgets** — `maxItemsPerRun` per source caps fetching;
`output.minLocalScoreForTriage` (raise it for a stricter free filter),
`output.maxItemsToTriage`, and `output.maxItemsInBrief` control the AI stages.

**Change the schedule** — `briefEditions`: `"am"`, `"pm"` (24-hour times) and
`timezone`. The web app's scheduler follows these directly; if you use cron instead,
also update your crontab.

## Adding a Future Source

Every source is one file in `src/adapters/` implementing the same small interface —
`id`, `label`, and `fetchItems({ sinceISO, topics, sourceConfig, env })` returning a
list of normalized items (`uid`, `sourceId`, `sourceLabel`, `title`, `summary`,
`url`, `publishedAt`, `jurisdiction`, `docType`, `raw`). Register it in
`src/adapters/index.js`, add a matching entry under `sources` in `watchlist.json`,
and you're done — budgets, incremental fetching, dedup, scoring, triage, and the
brief all apply automatically. `src/adapters/iowa_admin_rules.js` is a good template
for scraping a state website; note there is no unified API for state administrative
rules, so each additional state needs its own adapter like that one.

## Deploying to the Raspberry Pi (Umbrel)

You have Tailscale on both machines, which makes everything easier: `ssh
umbrel@umbrel.local` from your network, or `ssh umbrel@<pi-tailscale-name>` from
anywhere. Default password is your Umbrel dashboard password.

### Option A — Clickable Umbrel app (recommended)

This puts a **polibrief tile on your Umbrel home screen**. One-time setup, three parts:

**1. Publish the Docker image** (free Docker Hub account at hub.docker.com):
```bash
# from the polibrief folder, on any machine with Docker:
docker login
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -f docker/Dockerfile \
  -t YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/polibrief:1.0.0 --push .
```

**2. Publish the app store** (free GitHub account):
- Edit the two files under `umbrel-community-app-store/` replacing
  `YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` / `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`.
- Create a new **public** GitHub repo (e.g. `isa-umbrel-apps`) containing just the
  *contents* of the `umbrel-community-app-store/` folder.

**3. Install on Umbrel:**
- Umbrel dashboard → **App Store → ⋯ → Community App Stores** → paste your repo URL
  → Add → Open → install **polibrief**.
- Click the new tile once — the app creates editable `watchlist.json` and `.env`
  files in its data folder. SSH in and add your keys:
  ```bash
  nano ~/umbrel/app-data/isa-polibrief/data/.env
  ```
  then restart the app from the dashboard.

From then on: briefs run automatically at your am/pm times, and the tile opens the
reader. Over Tailscale it's also at `http://<pi-tailscale-name>:8484`.

### Option B — Plain Docker on the Pi (no app tile)

```bash
scp -r polibrief umbrel@umbrel.local:~/polibrief   # copy the folder over
ssh umbrel@umbrel.local
cd ~/polibrief && docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```
Open `http://umbrel.local:8484` (or the Tailscale name). Edit config in
`~/polibrief/polibrief-data/`.

### Option C — Bare metal + cron (no Docker at all)

```bash
scp -r polibrief umbrel@umbrel.local:~/polibrief
ssh umbrel@umbrel.local
cd ~/polibrief && bash scripts/install-pi.sh
```
The script checks the machine, installs Node 20 if needed, verifies the database
engine built, creates `.env` for you to edit, and prints the exact cron lines to add
(see `scripts/crontab.example` for the Central-vs-UTC timezone note).

### Checking logs

- Umbrel app: dashboard → polibrief → ⋯ → Logs (or `docker logs isa-polibrief_web_1`)
- Plain Docker: `docker logs polibrief`
- Cron: `tail -50 ~/polibrief/logs/cron.log`

## Cost Notes

Two-model strategy, deliberately: **Haiku** (cheap, fast) reads every candidate item
and votes relevant/not; **Sonnet** (smarter, pricier) makes exactly **one** call per
brief to write it. Model names live in `.env` so you can upgrade them without
touching code.

Measured during development: a full run with 64 new items cost **about $0.11**; a
quiet run with nothing new costs **$0.00** (no AI calls at all). At two runs a day
expect roughly **$3–8/month** at default budgets. Check anytime with
`node src/index.js audit`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause & fix |
|---|---|
| `HTTP 401/403 … (check the API key in .env)` from a source | Wrong or expired key in `.env`. The run continues without that source and says so in the brief footer. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set` | Add it to `.env` (the editable copy is in the app data folder on Umbrel). `--dry-run` works without it. |
| Congress.gov fetches 0 items | Usually normal — federal bills matching your topics don't move every day. |
| LegiScan errors about quota | Free tier is 30,000 queries/month; each run uses up to ~70. Trim `states` or per-topic `legiscan` queries if you ever hit it. |
| Iowa Admin Rules says "could not parse the bulletin" | The state changed its website markup. The run continues; the selector logic is isolated at the top of `src/adapters/iowa_admin_rules.js`. |
| better-sqlite3 won't install on the Pi | `sudo apt install -y build-essential python3` then `npm rebuild better-sqlite3 --build-from-source`. |
| Teams post fails with HTTP 4xx | The webhook URL is wrong or was deleted — create a new Incoming Webhook and update `.env`. Briefs are still saved locally either way. |
| "no items found" everywhere | First check `node src/index.js audit` for last-success times. If sources fail repeatedly from one network, try from the Pi — some networks block automated requests. |
| Want full error details | Re-run with `POLIBRIEF_DEBUG=1` set. |

## How It Works (one paragraph)

`collect.js` asks each adapter in `src/adapters/` for items published since that
source's last successful run (7-day cap on the first ever run), skipping anything
already in the SQLite database. `score.js` ranks the rest against your watchlist
keywords for free. Survivors go to Haiku in batches for relevance verdicts
(`triage.js`), every verdict is remembered so tomorrow it costs nothing, and one
Sonnet call (`brief.js`) turns the relevant items into the brief, which `deliver.js`
saves, posts to Teams, and/or emails. `server.js` is the web reader + scheduler that
the Umbrel tile opens.
